                <h2>what is the fastest car in the world?</h2>

                <h3>The fastest car in the world is thebugatti veyron.</h3>

                <p>The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is listed by Guinness World Records as the fastest production car in the world at 431 km/h (268 mph). The 1,200-horsepower legend beat out an impressive array of other cars, including its predecessor, the Bugatti Veyron, to claim the title.</p> 
                <p>The Supersport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest road-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph). The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse is the fastest sports car in the world, achieving an average top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in the April 6, 2013 test.</p>
                <p>You're all wrong, the Bugatti Veyron isn't the fastest car, and neither is the SSC Ultimate Aero. The new fastest car the world was the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which hit a top speed of 268 mph on the Volkswagen test site in Ehra-Lesien. The engine is just enlarged, the turbo and intercooler deliver 1200 hp, and this version sheds some weight as well.</p>
